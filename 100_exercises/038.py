# Question: The following code is supposed to print out the square root of 9, but it throws an error instead because another line before that is missing. Please fix the script so that it prints out the square root of 9.
'''math.sqrt(9)'''

# My answer:
# You need to import the module math before calling it:
import math
print(math.sqrt(9))
