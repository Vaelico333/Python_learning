# Question: Why is there an error in the code and how would you fix it?
'''def foo(a=1, b=2):
    return a + b
 
x = foo - 1'''

# My answer: 

# When calling the function foo, we have to add a parenthesis 
# after the function's name, where we would include 
# any parameters we need to pass to the function. 
# In this case, we don't need to pass any params, 
# so the parenthesis will be empty.
