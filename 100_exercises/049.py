# Question: The code is supposed to get some input from the user, but instead it produces an error. Please try to understand the error and then fix it.
"""pass = input("Please enter your password: ")""" 

# My answer:
# The word 'pass' is a keyword used by Python, so it can't be assigned to a value.
# The easiest fix is to change the variable's name:
password = input("Please enter your password: ")
